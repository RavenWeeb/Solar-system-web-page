# Web-page
Laboratory work for Web design

The goal was to make a web page with 3 tabs. The first one was a table with information about all the planets in our solar sistem and a link to NASA's chart with the same 
information as a fact check. The second one was a place where you fill in type of application form. And the last one was meant to attach a wikipedia page and an interactive 
google maps location of our university.
